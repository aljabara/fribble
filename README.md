The fribble project is a collection of SPITBOL programs related to word games such as Scrabble and Words With Friends (WWF).

The goal is to construct a program that can play WWF.

The Offical Rules for WWF can be found at:

It says the WWF uses a dictionary based on the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE), a public domain word list used by many games.

The ENABLE word list for WWF can be found at:

WWF also allows some additional words but I've seen no official list of them, so I'm building up a list as I encounter them while searching the dictionary within WWF, or observe them played by an opponent during a game.  These words can be found in the file wwf.txt
